# MinimapButtonBag vanilla
MinimapButtonBag cleans up your Minimap and relocates the buttons in a menu bar. You can still access them through a single minimap button.  

I started new trank from original addon MBB by Tunhadil for vanilla wow servers.

+Fixed some position bugs.

+Added square map support.

+Added some functionality.

If you want to reattach a button to the minimap just use Ctrl + Right click on it.

Use Ctrl + Right click again on the button to put it back into the bar.

Or hold the Ctrl key down and move the mouse cursor over the button. A button to add or remove will appear over that button.

Use Right click on the MinimapButtonBag button to open the options dialog.
